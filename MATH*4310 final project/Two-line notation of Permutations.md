# Example
$$
P = 

\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

It means $P(1) = 3$, $P(2) = 2$, etc.

The first row contains all elements of the permutation also acting as the pre-image and the second row acts as the image of the pre-image above.

If there is some "natural" order in the set, it's often written in that order in the first row.

- I find it hard to not take things personally, instead, often my solution is simply perfectionism or avoid the work entirely
- deep down, I often feel inadequate for *feeling* not smart enough to comprehend math quickly
    - some say math for most people is about practice than intuition but feeling inadequate sets up a bad feedback loop
        - yes the point above can be interpreted as another excuse
- all the disciplines I find useless also happen to be disciplines I am not very good at
    - I fooled myself thinking analysis is not useful in math until I learned they play a major role in combinatorics
    - I fooled myself thinking most algorithm questions are not useful in the real world yet even a fool knows it's not true

Perhaps the tendencies to be only interested in the things you are good at is related to my inability to not take things personally. As I realize being an adult also means doing lots of things you might not enjoy, it has come to bite me. At this moment, I cannot say I enjoy physical activity yet I know I must do them. Socializing also torments me (especially to girls) so I joke about I don't talk to normies. 

The world is mostly normies, at least the interfaces you can engage most people with are pretty *normie*. How do I know the other side of a conversation isn't also putting up a socially acceptable mask so they can engage the greatest number of people?

Do I really enjoy metal? At least some of them are aesthetically pleasing to me but how much is I'm trying to be different than normies? After all, most of the reasons I like the Early Norwegian Black Metal is about their politics.

What does it mean to be a metal fan? Can you separate metal from its socially nonconforming roots? When metal is popular within a certain demographic, does it not just become pop within that context? 

Although I enjoy both eras of In Flames, I find their post Clayman albums more personally relatable due to their lyrical content. Yet can you get a melodic metal band that is more "sold out" than In Flames?

[This](https://youtu.be/ZNemICpooWk) made me question that do I hate myself? I defend my preferences by claiming "to modernize is to westernize". However, this directly contradicts my interests in Japan---it craved out a special space in developed countries for being not in western Europe or north America.
